# 🔢 π Relationship Predictor  
Predict your **future partner** or **closest friend** using your **date of birth hidden inside the digits of π (Pi)**.

This project takes a user's **DOB (DDMMYYYY)**, searches for that exact number sequence inside the first **1 billion digits of π**, and then predicts relationships based on where it's found.

🌀 Built with **Python + Flask**  
🎨 Includes a fully-styled **dark UI web interface**  
⚡ Uses fast memory-mapped search on binary π data  
📁 Large dataset excluded from repo (generated locally)
